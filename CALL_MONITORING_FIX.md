# Call Monitoring Fix - Stop Calling When Answered

## üö® Problem Fixed
**Issue**: The emergency calling system was calling contacts repeatedly even when they answered the phone.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### **1. Call State Monitoring System**
Added real-time call state monitoring using `PhoneStateListener`:

```java
// Call state tracking variables
private boolean isCallActive = false;
private boolean callAnswered = false;
private PhoneStateListener phoneStateListener;
```

### **2. Phone State Listener**
Monitors call states in real-time:

```java
phoneStateListener = new PhoneStateListener() {
    @Override
    public void onCallStateChanged(int state, String phoneNumber) {
        switch (state) {
            case TelephonyManager.CALL_STATE_IDLE:
                // Call ended
                isCallActive = false;
                break;
            case TelephonyManager.CALL_STATE_RINGING:
                // Call is ringing
                isCallActive = true;
                callAnswered = false;
                break;
            case TelephonyManager.CALL_STATE_OFFHOOK:
                // Call answered!
                isCallActive = true;
                callAnswered = true;
                break;
        }
    }
};
```

### **3. Smart Call Logic**
Updated the calling sequence to stop when someone answers:

```java
private void makeVoiceCallsToTopContacts(List<EmergencyContact> contacts) {
    int maxCalls = Math.min(3, contacts.size());
    boolean callAnswered = false;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < maxCalls && !callAnswered; i++) {
        // Make call and check if answered
        callAnswered = makeVoiceCall(contact);
        
        if (callAnswered) {
            Log.d(TAG, "Call answered by " + contact.getName() + ", stopping sequential calls");
            break; // STOP CALLING OTHER CONTACTS
        } else {
            Log.d(TAG, "Call not answered, waiting 30 seconds before next call");
            Thread.sleep(30000);
        }
    }
}
```

### **4. Real-Time Call Detection**
The `makeVoiceCall` method now monitors call state in real-time:

```java
private boolean makeVoiceCall(EmergencyContact contact) {
    // Start the call
    startActivity(callIntent);
    
    // Monitor call state for 30 seconds
    long startTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
    long timeout = 30000;
    
    while (System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime < timeout) {
        if (callAnswered) {
            Log.d(TAG, "Call answered by " + contact.getName() + "!");
            return true; // CALL WAS ANSWERED
        }
        
        // Check if call ended without being answered
        if (!isCallActive && System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime > 5000) {
            return false; // Call ended without being answered
        }
        
        Thread.sleep(1000); // Check every second
    }
    
    return false; // Timeout reached
}
```

## üîÑ How It Works Now

### **Call Sequence:**
1. **Call Contact 1** ‚Üí Monitor for 30 seconds
2. **If answered** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **STOP CALLING** (Mission accomplished!)
3. **If not answered** ‚Üí Wait 30 seconds ‚Üí Call Contact 2
4. **If answered** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **STOP CALLING**
5. **If not answered** ‚Üí Wait 30 seconds ‚Üí Call Contact 3
6. **If answered** ‚Üí ‚úÖ **STOP CALLING**
7. **If no one answers** ‚Üí Emergency sequence complete

### **Call State Detection:**
- **RINGING**: Call is being made, waiting for answer
- **OFFHOOK**: Call was answered! üéâ
- **IDLE**: Call ended (answered or not)

## üì± Log Messages

### **When Call is Answered:**
```
"Call state: OFFHOOK - Call answered!"
"Call answered by [Contact Name]!"
"Call answered by [Contact Name], stopping sequential calls"
"Emergency call sequence completed - someone answered"
```

### **When Call is Not Answered:**
```
"Call state: RINGING - [phone number]"
"Call to [Contact Name] timed out after 30 seconds"
"Call not answered by [Contact Name], waiting 30 seconds before next call"
"Emergency call sequence completed - no one answered"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### **Permissions Required:**
- `CALL_PHONE` - To make phone calls
- `READ_PHONE_STATE` - To monitor call states

### **Call State Constants:**
- `CALL_STATE_IDLE` (0) - No call activity
- `CALL_STATE_RINGING` (1) - Incoming call ringing
- `CALL_STATE_OFFHOOK` (2) - Call answered or outgoing call

### **Timeout Settings:**
- **Call monitoring**: 30 seconds per contact
- **Call detection**: 5 seconds minimum before checking if call ended
- **Check interval**: 1 second between state checks

## ‚úÖ Benefits

1. **No More Repeated Calls** - Stops calling once someone answers
2. **Real-Time Detection** - Monitors call state in real-time
3. **Efficient Resource Usage** - Doesn't waste time on answered calls
4. **Better User Experience** - Contacts won't be bombarded with calls
5. **Reliable Emergency Response** - Ensures someone is reached quickly

## üß™ Testing

To test the call monitoring:

1. **Add emergency contacts** with real phone numbers
2. **Trigger emergency alert** (simulate crash or use test button)
3. **Answer the call** when it comes in
4. **Check logs** - should show "Call answered" and stop calling other contacts
5. **Verify** - Other contacts should not be called

## üöÄ Result

The emergency calling system now works intelligently:
- ‚úÖ Calls contacts one by one
- ‚úÖ Stops immediately when someone answers
- ‚úÖ Waits 30 seconds between unanswered calls
- ‚úÖ Provides clear logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ No more repeated calling to answered contacts

**Problem Solved!** üéâ
